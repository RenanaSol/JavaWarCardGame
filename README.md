# JavaWarCardGame

A Java implementation of the classic card game War, including war logic, round limits, and victory conditions.  
Developed as part of an advanced Java programming course at the Open University of Israel.

## Features

- Simulates the War card game using Java.
- Includes logic for handling "War" situations when cards are tied.
